Welcome to **Quint**, a Hugo theme designed for those who appreciate simplicity and elegance. Quint strips away the unnecessary, focusing on what's essential to create a light, airy, and highly readable web experience.

## Minimalist Design

At the heart of Quint lies a deep commitment to minimalism. This theme is crafted to ensure that every element serves a purpose, harmonizing both form and function. With Quint, your content takes the forefront, free from the distractions of overly complex design elements.

### Clean Typography

Quint uses the [Open Sauce Font](https://github.com/marcologous/Open-Sauce-Fonts) to enhance readability and ensures that your text is as enjoyable to read as it is easy on the eyes. The spacious line-height and optimal font sizes help reduce visual clutter, allowing your readers to focus on what matters most—the content.

### Light, Airy Color Palette

Using a palette that echoes the tranquility of early morning skies, Quint offers a refreshing visual experience. The soft greys and whites provide a backdrop that complements rather than competes with your images and text, creating a serene user experience.

## Table of Contents

An optional Table of Contents automatically appears as a side bar on any post with multiple headings.

## Responsive and Adaptive

Understanding the needs of users across different devices, Quint is meticulously designed to be fully responsive. Whether your readers are on a desktop, tablet, or mobile device, Quint adjusts beautifully and intuitively, providing a seamless experience across all platforms.

### Image-First Approach

The theme’s layout puts a strong emphasis on imagery, with an elegant banner that adapts to all screen sizes. The image banner not only captivates but also sets the tone for each post or page, making it an integral part of the storytelling.

## Easy Customization

Quint is designed to be flexible and easy to customize without ever touching the theme code. Easily add your custom styles with CSS.
